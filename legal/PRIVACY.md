# Privacy Policy for ProducerOS

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

## Our Commitment to Privacy

ProducerOS is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your music production workflow and sample library are personal, and we have no interest in collecting your data.

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

ProducerOS does **NOT** collect:

- Personal information (name, email, address)
- Audio samples or files
- File names or folder structures
- Usage patterns or analytics
- Location data
- Hardware identifiers
- Any data that leaves your computer

### What Stays on Your Computer

All data processed by ProducerOS remains **100% local**:

- Your sample library metadata
- BPM and key detection results
- Waveform caches
- Application preferences
- Task and project data

This data is stored in a local SQLite database on your computer and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Optional Crash Reporting

If you choose to enable crash reporting in Settings:

- Only **anonymous** technical data is sent (error type, stack trace, app version, OS version)
- **No personal data** is ever included
- **No file names** or paths are sent
- **No sample information** is transmitted
- You can disable this at any time

Crash reports help us improve ProducerOS by identifying and fixing bugs.

## Update Checks

When checking for updates, ProducerOS sends a simple request to our server containing only:

- Current app version
- Operating system type

No personal information is transmitted during update checks.

## Third-Party Services

ProducerOS does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage

All your data is stored locally:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\ProducerOS\` (settings and database)
- **Cache:** `.waveform_cache\` in your library folders

You can delete all ProducerOS data by removing these folders.

## Children's Privacy

ProducerOS does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website and updating the "Last Updated" date.
