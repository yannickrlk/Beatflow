## Marcus's Final Verdict

> "Before Phase 11, Beatflow was a decent sample browser. Now it's actually faster than digging through folders in my DAW. The global search + BPM filter combo is exactly what I needed for matching samples to my beats. The dark theme doesn't strain my eyes during late sessions.
>
> Only thing missing would be drag-and-drop to my DAW, but I can Copy Path and import. Solid 8.8/10."

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Drag & Drop to DAW** (User cancelled - deemed not needed)
2. **AI sample recommendations** (Low priority)
3. **Waveform zoom/preview** (Nice to have)
